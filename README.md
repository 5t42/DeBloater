Debloater "Delete Windows App's Like, One Drive, Microsoft Edge, Etc."

ðŸ”¹ Features in the Debloater Tool v1.0
1. Run tool (clear temporary files)

This option lets the user clear temporary files from specific folders.

The tool asks which folders to clean:

TEMP folder

Local Temp

Windows Temp

Prefetch

The script shows progress while deleting files, and then displays:

Number of files deleted

Free disk space before and after cleanup

How much space was freed

Total time taken

2. Run tool (doing nothing)

Downloads and runs the Debloater executable but does not delete any files.

Useful if you only want to run the tool itself.

3. Full Cleanup (all folders)

Automatically clears all temporary folders (TEMP, Local Temp, Windows Temp, Prefetch) without asking for selection.

Useful for a complete system cleanup in one step.

4. Clear Browser Cache

Allows the user to choose which browser cache to clear:

Chrome â†’ Clears the cache from the Chrome profile

Edge â†’ Clears the cache from the Edge profile

Firefox â†’ Searches for cache2 folders in Firefox profiles and deletes them

This helps free space and improve browser performance.

5. Clear Recycle Bin

Automatically clears the Recycle Bin for all drives on the system.

Ensures that deleted files are completely removed and disk space is freed.

Works without errors, even if some drives donâ€™t have a Recycle Bin.

6. Memory Optimizer

Runs garbage collection in .NET ([System.GC]::Collect() and WaitForPendingFinalizers()) to free up memory.

Helps reduce memory usage and make the system run more smoothly without restarting.
